# KnightErrant

Knight Errant is an experimental 2D mobile platformer Unity game. 

Players influence is restricted to only tapping the screen, making the green creature jump.
Neither jump height nor jump velocity can be altered by a player, which makes timing the jump correctly the key for beating highscores.

Presented pixel-art and animations are artifacts of my artistic nature, as I am the author.
